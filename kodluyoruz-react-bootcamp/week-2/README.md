## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap (Only table)

### What I learned

By completing this project, I learned how to create CSS screen layouts, design mobile-friendly and user-friendly web interfaces. Additionally, I gained practical experience in storing data in sessions on a web browser, manipulating and utilizing that data later, and creating an interactive web page using JavaScript.

### Continued development

In the future stages of the project, a real-world, useful to-do app can be developed by incorporating a database and a membership system.

### Useful resources

- [Flatui](https://flatuicolors.com) - Thanks to this website, I can easily switch between color palettes and conveniently copy my favorite colors with just a single click. I highly recommend it!
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - I was able to easily take my project live by simply creating a repository, so I highly recommend it.
